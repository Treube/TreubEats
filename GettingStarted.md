# Getting Started with the TreubEats Stack

This repository utilizes a modern tech stack comprising of Next.js, Prisma, React, Figma, TypeScript.

## [GitHub]

**[RCOS GitHub Workshop](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-eQ3q1j2jF8IHtqGQn_B98PfIQ4jnWncOf8XL6EONHc/edit#slide=id.g133ce440a1d_0_360)** - This was a presentation given to us by Professor Wes Turner and the RCOS Team. It includes definitons and steps and how to get started with GitHub

**[GitHub || Get Started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)** - Official documentation page of github with a variety of resources

## [React and Next.js]

**[React Foundations: About React and Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/what-is-react-and-nextjs)** - "React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI). It was created and is maintained by Facebook, and it has become one of the most popular libraries for front-end web development.
React is based on the concept of reusable components. These components are pieces of code that encapsulate the structure, logic, and styles of a specific UI element. Components can be nested and combined to create complex user interfaces."

**[Getting Started: Installation | Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation)** - Next.js is widely adopted for building React-based web applications, websites, and server-rendered applications. It simplifies many aspects of React development, such as routing, bundling, and server-side rendering, while providing powerful features for performance optimization and developer experience.

**[Next js Tutorial for Beginners | Nextjs 13 (App Router) with TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVnjOPwW4ZA&t=3s&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh)** - This is a youtube video we constantly reference to understand the in and outs of Next.js especially since we were using TypeScript.  

## [Prisma]
Prisma is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that simplifies database management and data access in modern applications. It acts as an abstraction layer between the application code and the underlying database, providing a type-safe and database-agnostic approach to working with databases.

**[Prisma Website](https://www.prisma.io/)** - Official page and doucmentation of prisma

**[Prisma Tutorial w/ Next.js 13](https://youtu.be/pYTb82QMCto?si=N4My0n1IAAskXA6U)** - Very insightful video to help beginners start and understand the elements of prisma

**[Prisma Resource Link 1](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/17604)** - The best way to learn is from others! This is a reference page to a discussion board of other "githubbers" who used Prisma in their repository

**[Prisma Resource Link 2](https://www.prisma.io/blog/nestjs-prisma-rest-api-7D056s1BmOL0#implement-crud-operations-for-article-model)** - A blog page showcase how to implement Prisma

**[Prisma Resource Link 3](https://vercel.com/guides/nextjs-prisma-postgres)** -A guide by the creator of Prisma. 
## [Figma]
**Not included** - Prior Photoshop and Design Knowledge

**[Figma Learn](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002051613-Get-started)** - This website is the official get started page with Figma. Figma is a collaborative web-based vector graphics editor and prototyping tool. It is primarily used for user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, as well as for creating illustrations, diagrams, and other graphics-heavy content. Many designers i know use this to design websites as the interface is very simple and familiar to use.


## [Creating a schema ]

Attached below are resources, I used to help me understand what a Schema is and how to properly create one. It helped me understand and implement all the elements needs for a excellent schema, which would then be the frame work for some of the code needed to be developed in the backend.

**[Schema Resources 1](https://www.holistics.io/blog/top-5-free-database-diagram-design-tools/)**

**[Schema Resources 2](https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step#create)**

**[Schema Resources 3](https://www.holistics.io/blog/top-5-free-database-diagram-design-tools/)**

**[Schema Resources 4](https://www.holistics.io/blog/top-5-free-database-diagram-design-tools/)** 

## [Postman]

**[Learning Center || Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/introduction/overview/)** - This is the learning page on the Postmans website.Postman is a application that facilitates API testing, development, and collaboration. It provides a user-friendly interface for sending HTTP requests, organizing APIs into collections, managing environments and variables, writing scripts for automation and data manipulation, generating documentation, monitoring API performance, and enabling team collaboration through sharing and version control. With its comprehensive set of features and cross-platform compatibility, Postman streamlines the entire API lifecycle, making it an efficient tool for us design, build, test, and monitor APIs efficiently for this project.

## [Design Inspiration]

**[Just Water Website](https://justwater.com/)** - This was one of the inspirations we used in designing our website. Something we took note of were the design and video on the home page and how the user login

**[Kobe's Kitchen Website](https://kobeskitchen.com/)** - Another piece of inspiration we took, the webiste was created by me previously for another cooking business originating in Binghamton University.
